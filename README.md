# mirage-clock-test

An implementation of Mirage's CLOCK and TIME types for unit-tests.

It is often useful to test code that uses `sleep` to implement timeouts or delays.
Running with the real clock makes the tests run unnecessarily slow.
`Mirage_clock_test` provides a clock that is under the control of the unit-tests and is independent of any real clock.

The `test/test.ml` file contains a simple example.
The `App` module represents the application being tested.
It runs two Lwt loops in parallel.
One logs "fizz" every three seconds, the other logs "buzz" every five seconds.

```
module App(C : V1.CLOCK)(T : V1_LWT.TIME) = struct
  let rec loop msg delay =
    T.sleep delay >>= fun () ->
    Log.info "[%.2f] %s" (C.time ()) msg;
    loop msg delay

  let main () =
    Lwt.choose [
      loop "fizz" 3.0;
      loop "buzz" 5.0;
    ]
end
```

The test code applies this to `Mirage_clock_test`, then uses the control functions `reset` and `run_to` to control the virtual clock:

```
module A = App(Mirage_clock_test)(Mirage_clock_test)

let () =
  Lwt_main.run begin
    Mirage_clock_test.reset ();
    Mirage_clock_test.run_to 100.0;   (* Start at time t=100 *)
    (* Start the main thread running. *)
    Lwt.async A.main;
    (* Nothing happens in the first second. *)
    Mirage_clock_test.run_to 101.0;
    Log.expect [];
    (* Lots happens in the first 15 seconds. *)
    Mirage_clock_test.run_to 115.0;
    Log.expect [
      "[103.00] fizz";
      "[105.00] buzz";
      "[106.00] fizz";
      "[109.00] fizz";
      "[110.00] buzz";
      "[112.00] fizz";
      "[115.00] fizz";
      "[115.00] buzz";
    ];
    print_endline "Tests passed!";
    Lwt.return ()
end
```

This code is based on the code used for [CueKeeper's unit tests](https://github.com/talex5/cuekeeper/blob/ce81f4e3c40b79d99ac4063d22cfba4cd568e7e5/tests/test.ml#L27).
